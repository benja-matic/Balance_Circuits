# Balanced State Networks
Here are some codes used for simulating networks of integrate and fire neurons. I used these codes to study the balanced state.

## Local Circuits
Local circuits include networks with random or structured connections, delta pulse synapses or synapses with a time constant, and networks that respect, or don't respect, Dale's law.

## Non-Local Circuits
Non-local circuits include two E/I pools that are coupled. I used these codes to study winner-take-all and rivalry, and the balanced state. One of these codes includes spike frequency adaptation which causes a winner-take-all network to rival. In these simulations I measured spiking statistics only during dominance or suppression intervals. The python code was used to model the distribution of inputs coming into a neuron.

## Various Functions
Junkyard of functions I may have used at one point.
